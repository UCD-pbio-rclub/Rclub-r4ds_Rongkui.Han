```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv, color = drv)) #this is really a funny looking plot. 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv)) #"group" aesthetics just group the data according to a category and overlay each group on top of each other. it does not add a separate visual feature (e.g. colors/shape/legend etc.)
